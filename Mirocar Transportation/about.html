    <p class="about-text">
      When searching for the right driving service you want to know the person
      behind the wheel will be trustworthy and responsible. With a sincere love
      for my work and a dedication to the comfort and safety of my customers, my
      goal is to create a premium limousine experience. My name is Daniel
      Mironescu, Owner and Operator of MIROCAR LLC. Through this business I have
      found my calling in life as a chauffeur. I truly enjoy what I’m doing and
      it is incredibly rewarding to see the excitement and satisfaction on my
      customers’ faces after each trip. Whether that be for a fun trip out on
      the town or a professional endeavor, I always make sure my clients feel
      valued and at ease in my vehicle. Automotives have always been a big part
      of my life. Before starting my own business, I was working in car sales. I
      have also driven limos for other companies. My ability to connect with
      people while respecting their space and privacy is why I am honored to
      have a thriving business with numerous repeat customers. This is more than
      a job to me; it is my passion! If you’re looking for a limo service that
      is dedicated to consistently delivering exceptional service, I would be
      thrilled to show you the MIROCAR difference. Call today to book a ride or
      get a quote for your transportation needs.
